# Accessibility Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the accessibility features and compliance of the Timeline App. The application has been designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for web accessibility.

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

### Perceivable
- **Text Alternatives**: All images have appropriate `alt` text descriptions
- **Time-based Media**: Not applicable (no audio/video content)
- **Adaptable**: Content can be presented in different ways without losing information
- **Distinguishable**: 
  - All text has sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)
  - Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of functionality
  - Images of text are not used

### Operable
- **Keyboard Accessible**: 
  - All functionality available through keyboard interface
  - No keyboard traps
  - Custom keyboard shortcuts documented
- **Enough Time**: No time limits on content
- **Seizures and Physical Reactions**: No flashing content
- **Navigable**: 
  - Clear navigation structure
  - Multiple ways to find content
  - Headings and labels describe topic or purpose
  - Focus visible and follows logical order

### Understandable
- **Readable**: Text content is readable and understandable
- **Predictable**: Web pages operate in predictable ways
- **Input Assistance**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### Robust
- **Compatible**: Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools

## Keyboard Navigation

### Timeline Items
- **Tab**: Move between timeline items
- **Enter/Space**: Open modal for selected item
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between timeline items (Up/Left for previous, Down/Right for next)
- **Home**: Jump to first timeline item
- **End**: Jump to last timeline item

### Modal
- **Tab**: Cycle through focusable elements within modal
- **Shift+Tab**: Cycle backwards through focusable elements
- **Escape**: Close modal and return focus to triggering element
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and interactive elements

## Screen Reader Support

### ARIA Roles and Attributes
- `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` for timeline structure
- `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` for modal
- `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` for modal content
- `aria-current="true"` for active timeline item
- `aria-label` for timeline items with date and title information

### Semantic HTML
- Proper heading structure (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`)
- Landmark roles (`role="main"`)
- Button roles for interactive elements
- List structure for timeline items

## Color Contrast

All text meets WCAG AA contrast ratio requirements (minimum 4.5:1):

- Primary text: `#eaeaea` on `#121212` (15.9:1)
- Secondary text: `#cccccc` on `#1f1f1f` (8.3:1)
- Accent colors: `#ffa726` on `#1f1f1f` (4.6:1)
- Focus indicators: `#ffa726` on `#121212` (4.6:1)

## Focus Management

### Modal Focus Trapping
- Focus is trapped within modal when open
- First focusable element (close button) receives focus when modal opens
- Focus returns to triggering element when modal closes
- Tab cycling works correctly within modal boundaries

### Focus Indicators
- Clear 2px solid outline for focused elements
- Sufficient color contrast for focus indicators
- Consistent focus styles across all interactive elements

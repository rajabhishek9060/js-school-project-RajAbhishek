# ðŸ•’ Timeline App

## Task 1: HTML. The Foundations of Web Design

This is the initial static setup for the Timeline App. It includes the basic HTML structure needed to build a timeline-based application.

### Features in this stage:
An index.html containing:
- A `<header>` with logo and theme toggle.
- A `<nav>` or container for filters/placeholders (empty for now).
- A `<section id="timeline">` where event markers will live.
- An empty `<div id="modal">` for future popâ€‘ups. 
Semantic tags for main content (`<main>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, etc.). 
A basic README.md with project title and stage-1 description.

## ðŸ“š Task 2: CSS and Preprocessors

Styling HTML into a responsive, polished layout.  
A `styles.css` (or SCSS) implementing:

- Responsive layout using Flexbox or CSS Grid for the timeline.
- Header styling, typography, and colour scheme.
- Placeholder styles for event markers (e.g. dots, labels).
- Modal base styles (hidden by default).
- Ensure your design adapts at breakpoints:
  - **Mobile** (<768px)
  - **Tablet** (768â€“1023px)
  - **Desktop** (â‰¥1024px)

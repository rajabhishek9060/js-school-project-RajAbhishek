# ðŸ•’ Timeline App

## Task 1: HTML. The Foundations of Web Design

This is the initial static setup for the Timeline App. It includes the basic HTML structure needed to build a timeline-based application.

### Features in this stage:
An index.html containing:
- A `<header>` with logo and theme toggle.
- A `<nav>` or container for filters/placeholders (empty for now).
- A `<section id="timeline">` where event markers will live.
- An empty `<div id="modal">` for future popâ€‘ups. 
Semantic tags for main content (`<main>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, etc.). 
A basic README.md with project title and stage-1 description. 

Next stages will include:
- Styling with CSS
- Dynamic event rendering with JavaScript
- Filtering and modal functionality
